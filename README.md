# Responsive multi-page website

## About
Our task is to create a website with which the user can navigate between multiple pages. 
The build should employ use of CSS Flexbox, to allow elements to grow and shrink responsively.
The design should be based upon initial wireframe sketches, which set out the structure and flow of the website.

## Approach
